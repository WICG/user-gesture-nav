      We propose a new CSS property `overscroll-action` to control the allowed navigation actions
      for overscroll gestures. This enables web applications to opt-out of certain gesture
      navigations that may be disruptive to their UI.

## Motivation
Most browsers implement a set of navigations actions that are triggered by user gesture (almost
always an "overscroll"). The user-agent relies on heuristics to detect whether the gesture should
result in a navigation or should be handled by the page. These heuristics may work in general case
but fail for certain applications. Such failures are particularly problematic because a navigation
action is a major context switch that disrupts user experience.

Over time, web developers have resorted to a set of workarounds to disable these navigation gestures
either to prevent said disruptions or to implement their own customized versions. Unfortunately
these workarounds are not always reliable and have major drawbacks. We believe a simple and reliable
way to control these gesture navigation will go a long way to address this platform pain point.

A survey of current gesture navigations:

* **Pull-to-refresh**: Mobile Chrome and Opera
* **Overscroll swipes** : Chrome, Desktop Safari, Desktop Firefox, IE, Edge^^
* **Scroll from edge**: Mobile Safari

^^ Current stable release of Microsoft Edge has no gesture navigation but they are adding [support
][edgeHTML-feature] for overscroll swipes due to popular demand.


## Usecases

### Disabling Pull-to-Refresh
Pull to refresh is a feature of Mobile Chrome (and Opera) where once the user overscrolls the page,
the browser shows a refresh animation and refreshes the page. The UX pattern was popularized by
native mobile applications as a way to fetch new content which in the context of the browser
translates to refreshing the page. However refreshing the page does not make sense and is not
relevant for some mobile web applications and can be disruptive and costly.

[Here][p2r-workarounds] is one example of developers trying to find solution to this. Appendix
contains a list of existing problematic workarounds for this.


### Disabling Swipe Navigations
Most major mobile and desktop browsers provide a swipe navigation feature where they navigate
backward and forward in history when a user swipes left or right and overscrolls the page. In some
page layouts (e.g., a page with edge-to-edge horizontal image carousel) it is very easy for a user
to trigger these navigation actions accidentally once they have reached the page extent.

Examples of developers trying to find a solution [here][swipe-workaround1], [here][swipe-
workaround2], [here][swipe-workaround3], and [here][swipe-workaround4]. Appendix contains a list of
existing problematic workarounds for this.

## Proposed Syntax
We introduce a non-inherited CSS property `overscroll-action`, that may be specified on the root
element and applies to the viewport. It controls the permitted overscroll actions by the browser.

`overscroll-action: [auto || [no-navigation-x | no-navigation-y]]`

* `auto`: The user agent determines appropriate default action for overscrolls in this axis and
  direction. This is the default value.
* `no-navigation-x`: overscroll on x axis should not cause any navigation such as back or forward
  history navigation. This value does not impact UI effects such as bounce or glow.
* `no-navigation-y`: overscroll on x axis should not cause any navigation such as a page refresh.
  This value does not impact UI effects such as bounce or glow.

This syntax forces the developer to be explicit about the actions that they want to prevent. The
granular control that this approach provides means that it is easier for user-agents to add
additional new overscroll actions or more fine-grained control, e.g., per-direction, in future.


*Syntax alternatives*:

`overscroll-action-{x,y}: [auto || none]`

This syntax mimics overflow-{x,y} syntax and allows controlling x and y axis separately making it
easier for different components to control the behaviour on each axis without coordination (e.g., a
routing library may want to control vertical overscroll, and a carousel may want to control
horizontal overscroll). However it lack the flexibility and fine grained control of the previous
one.

## Out of Scope
The following cases are out of scope for this proposal

### Cosmetic overscroll effects
Cosmetic overscroll effects such as glow, or bounce are out of scope of this proposal. Unlike
navigation, these affordances do not cause a drastic context-switch and usually play a role in
keeping platform UI consistent so browsers may not be willing to expose a way to disable them.
However this proposed syntax for CSS property does not prohibit its extension in order to cover that
case as long as we expand it to non-root scrollables.

### Navigation for gestures outside page content
Navigation gestures that do not need to compose with page content, e.g., swiping URL bar.

## Feature Detection and Polyfillability

Detecting existence of a CSS property is straight forward. A polyfill can use such detection and
fallback to using one of the existing workarounds which are unfortunately unreliable and have
limited applicability.


## Customizing vs Disabling
Some web applications (e.g., twitter) may be interested in keeping the pull-to-refresh UI affordance
but hook their own custom refresh logic replacing the browser's default. This is a different but
certainly a valid use-case which is best addressed by an event. We think we should address these two
cases separately starting with the disable use-case for the following reasons:

1. The cost of not being able to disable seems to be greater than not being able to customize. Also
   anecdotally it appears that most apps just want to disable rather than customize so we want to
   make sure there is a simple API for that. So it is important to address disable first.
2. Once we have a **reliable** way to disable UA's behaviour, it becomes much easier to create
   customization on top.
3. A synchronous event has unacceptable performance characteristic for any UI effect, such as
   scrolling, that needs to be smooth and potentially run in a separate thread. In these cases we
   need to know before scrolling starts what effect it can trigger.
4. There is some awkwardness in addressing both the disable and customize use-cases using a single
   event e.g., deciding whether pull-to-refresh animation should be shown or not.

## Appendix

### Pull-to-refresh existing workarounds
Below is a list of few workarounds used by apps to disable pull-to-refresh behaviour which come with
their own negative consequences:

1. Disable document scrolling, move all content in a scrollable div
  * Cons: forces a certain layout and loses top controls behaviour.
2. Disable vertical scrolling all together using ‘touch-action: none;’
  * Cons: Opting out of the user-agent scrolling machinery is over-kill and adds a lot of complexity
    to the application.
3. Add touch event handlers and prevent scroll if gesture is scrolling vertically in a way that
   induces a refresh (example: AMP implementation)
  * Cons: touch event handlers has perf implications for threaded scrolling and should be avoided if
    possible. Also this can become flaky if the app hits touch ack timeout.

### Swipe navigation workarounds
There are several workarounds but similar to pull-to-refresh these are either unreliable, or
complicated, or have performance drawbacks, or a combination of these. Also none of these work in
Mobile Safari.

* Prevent-defaulting touch event handlers (or wheel event for desktop browsers) similar to pull-to-
  refresh.
* Using `touch-action: pan-y` on document to prevent horizontal (or vertical pan)
* Use scroll chaining: This is an IE specific workaround and disables scroll chaining (`--ms-scroll-
  chaining: none`) on root scroller. This actually does not work well in practice as it only
  prevents overscroll action if the page is not scrolled fully to its extent and requires the page
  to be scrollable
